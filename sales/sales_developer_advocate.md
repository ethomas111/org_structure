Developer Advocate
Redocly is looking for a developer advocate role. We make API design and documentation software with the goal to improve the writer and developer experience. Our customers are software developers and technical documentation writers and product managers. The goal of this role is to help the community of developers by advocating for a docs-like-code approach and offering them the skills and know-how for how to make it happen.

Redocly is the leader in enterprise API reference and documentation portals. We subscribe to a docs-as-code philosophy, which means applying the common practices for software development into documentation such as using version control software (we love GitHub) and continuous integration workflows.

Consider if these sentences describe you, from a scale of 1 (least) to 5 (most). Be realistic in your assessment.

You believe technical writers are generally under-tooled and under-resourced (we’re trying to solve that).
You are respected within the developer community.
You are good at explaining technical concepts.
You speak and present well, and have experience doing that at conferences.
You have strong opinions about API design, but you are open to other ideas.
You love APIs -- can’t get enough of them.
You have a strong working knowledge of git and the OpenAPI spec (formerly known as Swagger).
You enjoy being on a cross-functional team.
You want to make the world a better place for API developers, API consumers and technical writers.
You are comfortable providing critical feedback to others, especially those on your own team.

Here is an example of what we would expect:

Month 1, you become a power “user” of our API registry and reference docs product. You increase your command of OpenAPI and are able to describe complex schema.
Month 2, you become a power “user” of our Dev Portal product. You understand how to customize many of the things. You become involved in our community of open source products on GitHub. You ideate for talks at industry conferences.
Month 3, you submit for talks at industry conferences. You are actively participating in community platforms like GitHub issues, Twitter, and Slack.
Month 4, you establish enough relationships to give you enough information that you can curate and present these ideas internally for product improvements.
This is just an example. Actual work and goals may vary, as we believe you should be involved in setting your goals once you understand our overall goals, product, and customers.
If you’re looking to join a team where you can grow, work along-side thought leaders in the API world, and deliver fantastic products that delight our customers, send an email to us: careers@redoc.ly.
