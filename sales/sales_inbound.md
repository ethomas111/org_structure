Sales Development Representative (Inbound)
Redocly is looking for our first sales development representative to help screen, qualify and nurture leads. We make API design and documentation software with the goal to improve developer experience. Our customers are software developers and technical documentation writers and product managers.

Redocly is the leader in enterprise API reference and documentation portals. We subscribe to a docs-as-code philosophy, which means applying the common practices for software development into documentation such as using version control software (we love GitHub) and continuous integration workflows.

Consider if these sentences describe you, from a scale of 1 (least) to 5 (most). Be realistic in your assessment.

You will walk through walls to win.
You are a good listener.
You have empathy for customers and do what you say.
You are a good writer (you can sell with the written word as well as the spoken word).
You love APIs and documentation.
You have a basic working knowledge of git and the OpenAPI spec (formerly known as Swagger), or aren’t afraid to learn it.
Add up your score. If your total is 20 or higher, keep reading…

Here is an example of what we would expect:

Within 2 months, you became a power “user” of our products and you understand the jobs our customers need done.
Within 4 months, you are talking to prospects daily, and have an organized system for segmenting and leading prospects down the sales pipeline.
Within 6 months, you are a shining model of sales execution at Redocly.
